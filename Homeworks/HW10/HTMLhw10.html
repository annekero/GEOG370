<h1>Homework 10: Bike Path Access from Residential Areas </h1>
<h2>Anneke Oosten</h2>
<h3>This map is a visual representation of the answer to the question: Which residential areas in Raleigh, NC are not within a quarter mile of a bike path?</h3>
<h3>This information would be useful to anyone looking for areas to add bike paths to in order to increase access, and make a more cohesive system</h3>
<h3>The areas considered are only areas that are zoned specifically as neighborhoods, meaning there is no mixed-use development whatsoever. While this is narrow, every zoning type has different issues, and it is worthwhile to focus on each one individually.</h3>
